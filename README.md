# dizzbase_demo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

To understand how the dart/flutter dizzbase client works, look at dizzbase_demo_widget.dart first - there you can see how data is retrieved from the database.
In dizzbase_demo_ui.dart there are more widgets that demonstrate how to insert/update/delete data.
